# Calculator Web App
This is a simple calculator web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, featuring a display area for input and output, numeric buttons, and operator buttons. The styling is done using CSS to provide a visually appealing and responsive design. The JavaScript code handles the logic behind the calculator, capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating the display accordingly.
